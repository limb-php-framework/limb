====== Howto setup Limb3 based project ======

To setup Limb3 based project first create a directory somewhere inside your root web folder, say **/var/www/limbapp**. The easiest way to start Limb3 is to download sandbox application (empty application with minimum design and with bundled main Limb3 packages) from SourceForge http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=109345&package_id=239481.

After you downloaded limb-app to the following::

  * Unpack limb-app archive into you project directory /var/www/limbapp. (we consider /var/www - is your document root and available via web server as http://localhost)

  * Make sure Apache has write permition for /var/www/limbapp/var. If not then just type:

 $ chmod  777 /var/www/limbapp/var

That it! 

Now you can check your installation by typing http://localhost/limbapp/www in you browser. If everything is ok, you will see something like this:

{{{ limb3:en:limb_app.png  |}}}

You can also may want to setup virtual host for your project:

  * Add a new host for limbapp in Apache httpd.conf file:

  <VirtualHost *>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/limbapp/www/
    ServerName limbapp
    ErrorLog logs/limbapp-error_log
    CustomLog logs/limbapp-access_log common
  </VirtualHost>

  * Add limbapp ip-address in /etc/hosts(or %WINDOWS%/system32/drivers/etc/hosts for Windows):

  127.0.0.1  limbapp

  * Restart Apache

  * Type http://limbapp/ in you browser
