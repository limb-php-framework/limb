====== DAO - Data Access lmbObject======
 

===== Description =====

DAO classes are used to unify the process of getting raw data from the persistence layer(it's on the TODO list to rename current DAO implementation into RecordSet).

DAO classes can have two methods:
  * **fetch()** that returns **Iterator**
  * **fetchById($id)** that returns DataSpace. This method is used in [[lmbDataMapper]].

To create a DAO object you can use this code:
<code php>
 $toolkit = lmbToolkit :: instance();
 $mapper = $toolkit->createDAO('ArticleDAO');
</code>

DAO class file will be automatically found with [[lmbFileSchema]].
