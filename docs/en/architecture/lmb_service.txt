====== Limb3 Services ======

===== Short description =====

lmbService - is a group of Actions, related to some domain or functional area. For example, for user authentication we can create and use Login lmbService, to work with site structure - SiteStructure lmbService, etc.

Action - is a functional unit of a Limb-based application. Action always belongs to some lmbService. 

Services are the first candicates for customization in every Limb-based applications.

**lmbService** class accepts name, service specific properties and actions properties in constructor:

<code php>
$service = new lmbService('404', 
                       array('display' => array('command' => LPKG_CORE_DIR . '/src/command/lmbSet404ErrorViewCommand')),
                       arrray('default_action' => 'display',
                              'filter' => 'simple'));
</code>

You can create lmbService object using [[lmbToolkit]] :: **createService($name)** method. createService($name) is supported by [[lmbBaseTools]] class.

===== How services are defined? =====

**lmbBaseTools :: createService($name)** delegates lmbService creation to a service factory object. lmbServiceFactory uses ini-files to load lmbService information. lmbService ini-files can be found in /settings/services/ folder of Limb-based application.

lmbService ini-files has .service.ini suffix. For example, Login.service.ini, SiteStructure.service.ini.

Here is an example of service ini-file:
<code>
[display]
command = {lmb_TEXT_PAGE_DIR}/command/lmbTextPageDisplayCommand

[create]
command = {lmb_TEXT_PAGE_DIR}/command/lmbTextPageCreateCommand
jip = true
icon = create.gif

[edit]
command = {lmb_TEXT_PAGE_DIR}/command/lmbTextPageEditCommand
jip = true
icon = edit.gif

[delete]
command = {lmb_TEXT_PAGE_DIR}/command/TextPageDeleteCommand
jip = true
icon = delete.gif
