====== CRUD - basic example of Limb3 based Create-Read-Update-Delete application ======

===== The main goals of this tutorial =====

  * Show the basics of Limb3 framework
  * Demonstrate how to create an application with Limb3 from the scratch using WEB_APP package
  * Make a short glance at WACT template engine: main tags, expressions etc.

You can find the source code of the example at [[http://projects.limb-project.com|Limb3 projects section]] (see CRUD).


===== System requirements =====

  * OS: *nix, Windows 98/ME/2000/XP
  * Web-server: Apache 1.3+ (with mod_rewrite)
  * PHP: PHP 5.1.4+
  * DB Server: MySQL 4.1+ or [[http://sqlite.org/|SQLite]]

You can place your project files somewhere in your Apache DocumentRoot or you can also setup your web server with a Virtual Host:

<code>
<VirtualHost *>
  DocumentRoot /var/dev/crud/www/
  ServerName crud
  ErrorLog logs/crud-error_log
  CustomLog logs/crud-access_log common
</VirtualHost>
</code>

Also make sure what Apache reads .htaccess files from your application directory. There should be something like this in Apache httpd.conf file:

<code>
 <Directory "/var/dev/">  
     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks  
     AllowOverride All  
 </Directory>  
</code>





===== Limb3 packages =====

Limb3, as framework, distributed via several packages, like, CORE, ACTIVE_RECORD, WEB_APP, DBAL etc. You can read a short tutorial about [[limb3:en:packages_architecture|Limb3 packages]].

For our example application we need WEB_APP package and all other packages WEB_APP depends on. 

The simplest way is to get WEB_APP via [[http://pear.limb-project.com|Limb3 PEAR channel]]:

<code>
  #PEAR-1.5 is in alpha
  $ pear install PEAR-alpha 
  # discovering Limb3 PEAR channel
  $ pear channel-discover pear.limb-project.com
  #web_app is in alpha too
  $ pear install limb/web_app-alpha 
</code>

There are [[limb3:en:how_to_download|many different ways to get Limb3 source code]]. For example you can download the release archive of Limb3 from SourceForge.net or checkout the code from SVN - just use method you feel comfortable with.
