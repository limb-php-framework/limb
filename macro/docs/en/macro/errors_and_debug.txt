====== {{macro}} error messages and templates debugging ======

===== Template compilation errors =====

%%{{macro}}%% compiler can detect the most of errors in templates.

Here is the list of errors that are considered to be fatal for a %%{{macro}}%% template:
  * Unbalanced template, that has an opening tag in one template and does not have a corresponding closing tag in the same template file(in case if this tag requires a closing tag).
  * Missing a required attribute for a tag
  * Improper nesting of %%{{macro}} tags. For example you can't use {{list:item}} tag outside {{list}}%% tag
  * Having two or more child tags of one parent tag with the same **id** attribute.
  * Usage of none existing file with [[.tags:CoreTags:IncludeTag|tag {{include}}]] or [[.tags:CoreTags:WrapTag|tag {{wrap}}]].
  * Usage of none existing filters in expressions
  * Usage of none existing tags

%%{{macro}} compiler tells you about error with short message and points at the template file and line number where error occurred.%%

===== Compiled template =====

You can find all compiled %%{{macro}}%% templates in **var/compiled/** folder of your application. If you have a template that throws a error at runtime then you may want to switch off template recompilation and insert debugger break command(e.g. debugBreak(), for [[http://dd.cron.ru/dbg/|dbg]]) at the problematic point of compiled template. In some cases just a short glance at the compiled PHP code is enough to understand the source of problem in template.
